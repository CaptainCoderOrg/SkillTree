# Let's Make a Skill Tree
{: .no_toc }

![Skill Tree](imgs/Skill%20Tree.png)

Hello coders! Captain Coder here with another learning series. On the Captain
Coder's Academy discord, it was proposed that I implement a Skill Tree live on
stream. I felt this fit into the current theme of prepping for the [2023
Dungeon Crawler Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2023) 

This site serves as a blog that will (hopefully) chronicle the streams for
anyone who missed them live and recap what we accomplished each day. I
hope someone finds this blog useful!

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a functional skill tree system
that can be dropped into an existing project, restyled, and reused.

## Day 1 - Design Document and Project Scope

Today, we defined our learning goals, specified the scope of the project, setup
a unity project, class class library project, [xUnit] test project, and defined
a few interfaces: `ISkilledCharacter`, `ISkillNode`, and `ISkillTree`.
